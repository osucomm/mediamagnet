Getting Started
===============

Welcome to Media Magnet!

Logging In
----------

To get started, you need to log in using your Ohio State username, also
called your name dot number. From the home page, click the large Login button or
click the login link in the menu bar. You will be asked for your username and
password.

Finding an Entity
-----------------

A Media Magnet "entity" represents a group of people or organizations that
produce and manage digital content properties. Take a look at the
[list of entities](/entities) to see if you group is already represented. To
join, send a message to one of the entity members. (Hint: clicking a member's
name will open an email)

If you can't find your group, it might be time to [register a new entity](/entities/new)
that you can call home. Once you complete the registration form, your entity
will be created automatically and you can start adding channels immediately!
