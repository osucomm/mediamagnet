Media Magnet
============

#What is Media Magnet?
Media Magnet is a web service for aggregating and coordinating digital content across the university.

#Why is this needed?
OSU is big place! We produce many thousands of pieces of digital content each year: Web features, event listings, blog posts, tweets, instagrams, etc. Through keyword tagging and aggregation, Media Magnet provides a way to relate and combine separate pieces of content.

#How does keyword tagging help coordinate content?
Media Magnet provides a [universal set of keywords][1] based on commonly used university themes (like "Academics" and "Buckeye Pride"). Once applied, the tags are like glue, bits of meta-data allowing binding individual content to one another.

#How is relating content useful? How does it benefit our audiences?
Media Magnet makes content filterable and reusable. It provides a simple mechanism to reuse content in other locations and contexts: Narrow-casting content based on user's preferences. Content mash-ups. Events calendars based on specific topics. Greater visibility and awareness of communications produced across the university.

#What types of content can be aggregated?
Media Magnet can consume just about any content "channel": web content, common social media platforms (Youtube, Twitter, etc.).
