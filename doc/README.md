Media Magnet
============

What is Media Magnet?
---------------------

Media Magnet is a web service for aggregating and coordinating digital content across the university.

Why is this needed?
-------------------

OSU is big place! We produce many thousands of pieces of digital content each year: Web features, event listings, blog posts, tweets, instagrams, etc. Through keyword tagging and aggregation, Media Magnet provides a way to relate and combine separate pieces of content.

How does keyword tagging help coordinate content?
-------------------------------------------------

Media Magnet provides a [universal set of keywords][/keywords] based on commonly used university themes (like "Academics" and "Buckeye Pride"). Once applied, the tags are like glue, bits of meta-data binding individual content to one another.

### How is relating content useful? How does it benefit our audiences?

Media Magnet makes content filterable and reusable. It provides a simple mechanism to repurpose content in new ways and contexts: Narrow-casting content based on user's preferences. Related reading. Content mash-ups. Events calendars based on specific topics. Greater visibility and awareness of communications produced across the university.

What types of content can be aggregated?
----------------------------------------

Media Magnet can consume just about any public content "channel": Web site content like news, events and blog posts, as well as feeds from popular social media platforms (the Youtubes, Twitter, etc.). Take a look at the different [channel types](key_concepts/#channels) available.
