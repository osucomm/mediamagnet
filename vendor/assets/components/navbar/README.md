The Ohio State University Nav bar
=================================

The nav bar is the single common element across all university sites. It 
provides quick links back to the university home page and several other central 
resources. The current version of the nav bar incorporates responsive layout 
and high-resolution graphics for mobile screens. Recommended width is 100%, 
with a centered container to restrain the content.

#### Bower
